    <td>The first trick that most people learn is called the ollie.<br>
        The ollie is likely the most basic trick as<br>
        your feet never come off of the board.<br>
    <td>The ollie is performed by pushing down<br>
        on the tail of the board with your<br>
        back foot(called popping) and sliding<br>
        your front foot up towards the nose of the board<br>
        This lifts the board of of the ground without<br>
        any spinning or flipping.

    <td><img src="../Images/kickflip.jpg" width=300 height=237>
    <td>The kickflip is generally the next trick<br>
        that people learn.<br>
        It is similar to the ollie in the way<br>
        that there is no spin, but different<br>
        because there is flipping rotation.
    <td>The kickflip is also performed by popping<br>
        the tail with your back foot and sliding your<br>
        other foot up towards the nose of the board<br>
        However this time the foot is slid to the side<br>
        when sliding your foot up and you flick out your ankle<br>
        The board should do a full rotation and<br>
        you land with both feet on the board.
