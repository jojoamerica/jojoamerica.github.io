<table class='content'>
    <tr>
        <td>The first trick that most people learn is called the ollie.<br>
            The ollie is likely the most basic trick as<br>
            your feet never come off of the board.<br>
        <td>The ollie is performed by pushing down<br>
            on the tail of the board with your<br>
            back foot(called popping) and sliding<br>
            your front foot up towards the nose of the board<br>
            This lifts the board of of the ground without<br>
            any spinning or flipping.
        <td>
            <div style="height:237px; background: url('/Images/ollie.jpg') center 20% no-repeat;background-size: cover;"></div>

    <tr>
        <td>
            <div style="height:237px; background: url('/Images/kickflip.jpg') center center;background-size: cover;"></div>
            <!--<img src="../Images/kickflip.jpg" width=300 height=237>-->
        <td>The kickflip is generally the next trick<br>
            that people learn.<br>
            It is similar to the ollie in the way<br>
            that there is no spin, but different<br>
            because there is flipping rotation.
        <td>The kickflip is also performed by popping<br>
            the tail with your back foot and sliding your<br>
            other foot up towards the nose of the board<br>
            However this time the foot is slid to the side<br>
            when sliding your foot up and you flick out your ankle<br>
            The board should do a full rotation and<br>
            you land with both feet on the board.
