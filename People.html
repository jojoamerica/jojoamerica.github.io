            He is the owner of the companies<br>
            ReVive and Force wheels.He has a son called Ryden<br>
            and his wife is called Brittany.<br>
            He lives in Cincinnati, Ohio and works in<br>
            a place that he calls "The Shredquarters"(right)<br>
            I like him because he makes good videos and is good at skating<br>

        <td>Another one of my favourite skateboarders is Sam Tabor(left)<br>
            He also lives in Cincinnati and is friends with Andy.<br>
            He makes videos and is very talented. He skates for<br>
            ReVive and works in The Shredquarters too.<br>
            I like him because he has a different style of skating<br>
            than most people as he likes No Comply tricks<br>
            and strange variations of lines.
