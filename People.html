    <td>One of my favourite skateboarders is Andy Schrock(left)<br>
        He is the owner of the companies<br>
        ReVive and Force wheels.He has a son called Ryden<br>
        and his wife is called Brittany.<br>
        He lives in Cincinnati, Ohio and works in<br>
        a place that he calls "The Shredquarters"(right)<br>
        I like him because he makes good videos and is good at skating<br>

    <td>Another one of my favourite skateboarders is Sam Tabor(left)<br>
        He also lives in Cincinnati and is friends with Andy.<br>
        He makes videos and is very talented. He skates for<br>
        ReVive and works in The Shredquarters too.<br>
        I like him because he has a different style of skating<br>
        than most people as he likes No Comply tricks<br>
        and strange variations of lines.
